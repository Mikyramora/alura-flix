      "descripcion": "Dotwork tattoos are viewed as one of the least painful types of tattoo. The precise, delicate dots used to build up an image do not drag the skin and therefore cause less pain. Getting a dot work tattoo in a low pain location such as back of the shoulder will mean a relatively less painful tattoo."
